Explanatory data analysis


The code have been provided to be performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset.

#Import necessary libraries:

It starts by importing essential Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and warnings.

#Read the dataset:

It reads a dataset from a CSV file named 'adult.csv' using pandas and assigns it to the DataFrame 'df'.

#Display the first few rows of the dataset:

The code uses df.head() to show the first few rows of the dataset, providing an initial glimpse of the data's structure and content.

The main purpose is to load and prepare the dataset for further analysis by renaming columns and setting up the environment for data visualization. EDA is a crucial step in understanding the structure and characteristics of your dataset before applying machine learning or statistical analysis.
